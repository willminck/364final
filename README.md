# 364final
**Spotify Playlist Generator**
For my final SI 364 project, I created a Flask application that allows a user to access the Spotify API. A user must first register and log into the application. Then, the user can enter artists and songs he or she wants to learn more information about. Additionally, the application allows a user to create his or her own customized playlists. The user will toggle through the added songs within the database to create the playlist. Also, the user can generate a playlist from any genre he or she likes and specify the amount of songs on the playlist. This option provides the user with new, recommended songs from Spotify's suggestions algorithm. Finally, the user can enter his or her favorite song and artist.

Requirements:

'/register' --> register.html
